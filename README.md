# Alzheimer-Stage-Detection
Using Ml and Deep Learning

Artificial intelligence offers a promising avenue for Alzheimer's disease stage detection. By analyzing patient data, including brain imaging and cognitive assessments, AI models can accurately classify individuals into different disease stages.Alzheimer has stages :
1. Mild Demented
2. Moderate Demented
3. Non-Demented
4. Very Mild Demented

The main inspiration behind this project is to make highly accurate model that predict the stage of Alzheimerâ€™s.

This project also contains Alzheimer Detection U.I. using HTML,CSS and JS.
